#  (2021) Oil Production Predictive Model Transfer. VBA Parser from Excel Spreadsheet to VBA Code
**Project Type:** Commercial project, Predictive Model Transfer  
**Programming Language:** Visual Basic  
**Project Ð¡ode:**  [Export.bas](https://github.com/ResearchMachine/commercial-project-parcing-of-predictive-complex/blob/main/formula%20hierarchy%20export.bas)  
**Company:**  [Gazprom Neft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom_Neft)  




### I. Motivation and Problem
The model, which is regularly used by the company, is at an early stage of development. It is necessary to examine the model and translate it into code.


### III. Key Results 
* Complex (>600 formulas) company model translated from Excel into VBA code;
* Fixed 3 mathematical inaccuracies in the complex model;
* A script has been developed that automatically translates the hierarchy of Excel formulas into raw VBA code.

### III. Content
**Previously:** A tool for predicting the volume of oil production based on simplified physics models, implemented as an Excel calculation file consisting of more than 600 formulas on 7 sheets.  
**What happened:** a mathematical examination of the methodology was carried out and mathematical inaccuracies were eliminated, a prototype of a VBA application with a graphical interface and the ability to input and output data on one sheet was implemented.
