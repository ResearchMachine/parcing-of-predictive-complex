Hydrodynamic Simulator Development. Forecast of Oil Production of special Group of Wells, Finite Element Method.
individual commercial project. Company: Gazpromneft Technology Partnerships LLC (RUS). Programming Language: Python 3 (fipy, matplotlib, numpy).
I. Motivation
Earlier in the project [(2021) Complex Predictive Model Transfer](https://github.com/ResearchMachine/commercial-project-parcing-of-predictive-complex) the complex model was transferred from Excel format to VBA format. This model does not take into account hydrodynamics, which leads to the need for manual fitting of the model.
II. Problem
The main goal of this project is the introduction of a hydrodynamic model into the forecast complex.
III. key results
The model solver (finite element method, fipy library) was selected, which made it possible to repeat the result of the commercial simulator tNavigator (maximum deviation 5%).
